are
designing
a
system
for handling different types of files.You want to ensure that all file handler classes implement certain essential methods, such as read() and write().

Provide
example
code
demonstrating
how
to
create
an

with abstract methods read() and write(), and how to create concrete classes like TextFileHandler and BinaryFileHandler that inherit from FileHandler.
