Scenario: You
have
a
function
process_sound(sound_object)
that
expects
an
object
with a make_sound() method.You have two classes, Dog and Cat, both of which implement the make_sound() method, but in different ways.

Provide
example
code
demonstrating
how
the
process_sound()
function
can
work
with both Dog and Cat objects without needing to know their specific types.
